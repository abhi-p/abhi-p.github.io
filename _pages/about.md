**Summary:**

 Hi there! I am Data Scientist/ML Engineer with over four years of experience working with cross-functional teams in building systems that leverage data to deliver tailored solutions into production. Self-motivated and lifelong learner capable of building end-to-end ETL pipelines and ML systems.
 
 I've had some great experiences working at Rogers Communications as a Senior Data Scientist, where I built cool tools like JARVIS (a RAG chatbot that leverages Meta's Lamma3 in order to query databases and retrive data), forecasting models, sentiment analyis social media montering tools. 
 
 While working I wanted to know more about NLP fundamentals and by Fall 2022 I started my Masters of CS at UT Austin to sharpen skills and am set to graduate in June 2024. Before this I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto.
