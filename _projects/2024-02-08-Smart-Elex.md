**Description:**
Chatbot that answers factual questions based on the dense telecom documentation (Ericsson and 3GPP documentation). Created a data pipeline that ingested pdfs, json and html files in order to get encodings. The chatbot consisted of two modes

i) document search which used the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 model.
ii) generative which used the llama-2-7B-chat-hf model

Allows Radio Engineers to quickly search up information without needing to go through the Ericsson adnd 3GPP documentation.
