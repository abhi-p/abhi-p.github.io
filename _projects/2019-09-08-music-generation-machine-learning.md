excerpt: "The goal of this project was to create a music composition application which utilizes machine learning to generate music extensions. Using our application, a user is able to play a melody on a MIDI keyboard, and the application uses it to generate a continuation of that melody for the same length of time. Users are prompted to play a melody, which is then transformed using the same transformations used on the dataset, and then fed through the final model to generate a continuation of the played notes. The user’s recording and the model’s generated continuation of their melody is then saved and displayed to them.

We worked on the Machine Learning pipeline from start to finish, figuring out data transformation techniques to convert music into machine readable embeddings, developing and training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and integrating the final model is then with a user interface and a physical MIDI keyboard.

Overall, our team was successful in creating a music composition application using neural networks.  We developed a useful framework for future development of neural network models for music generation. ur framework can be used in future development of models, with little code needed to be written, simply by using different datasets and alterations of model parameters."
