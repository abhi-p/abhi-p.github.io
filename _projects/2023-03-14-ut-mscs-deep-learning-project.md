excerpt: "This project consisted of training an agent to play SuperTuxKart to compete with the other trained agents in a 2v2 hockey game. Our strategy was to utilize reinforcement learning to minimize the player-puck and puck-goal distance. Our initial attempt at using Q Reinforcement Learning had trouble learning optimal strategies. Imitation Learning was then used to train the model on the winning strategies of over 2000 games. Our reinforcement learning model was then improved by using the imitation model as its initialization in order to further refine the agent's strategy. Future work can involve utilizing data augmentation during training in order to randomize initialization. A hand-crafted internal state controller could also be designed to see if it is superior to the AI models."
